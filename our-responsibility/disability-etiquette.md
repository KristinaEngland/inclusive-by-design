# Disability Etiquette

These are only general best practices. The most important best practice is to listen to disabled people when they correct you. We all make mistakes - the big thing is to learn from those mistakes and to acknowledge we did so.

## Recognize and respect bodily autonomy and personal privacy

Don’t touch or handle a disabled person/person with a disability, their adaptive equipment or assistive technology, or their service animal without specific permission. Ask if someone needs help, rather than assuming they do.

## Treat disabled people with the same respect and recognition as anyone

Speak to disabled person/person with a disability directly, not to a third party next to them, whether a friend or a sign language interpreter. Don’t avoid looking at or interacting with disabled people. Don’t make tasteless jokes about disabilities, or treat needs and requests as a burden.

## Listen to disabled people

Don't talk over a disabled person/person with a disability or assume you know what's best for that disabled person/person with a disability because you know someone else with a disability. A common quote in the disability community is, "If you know one disabled person, you know one disabled person." Disabled people/people with disabilities are not a monolith - they have different needs and different lived experiences.

## Use the word disability

Disabled people/people with a disabilities do not have an issue with the word disability. There is a whole Twitter campaign called [#SayTheWord](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SayTheWord&src=typed_query) promoting the words disability and disabled. It is how the community identifies. Over the years, non-disabled people have come up with new terminology (i.e. euphemisms). This terminology is often established as a way to make a non-disabled person comfortable with discussing disabilities and hinders progress for the disability community. 

### Terms to Avoid

These terms are disliked by various groups within the disability community. There are people in the disability community that do use these terms so, if a disabled person/person with a disability uses the term, you should not argue with them on whether the term should be used or not. However, non-disabled people should avoid using these terms due to the inherent issues with these words, especially when used by the non-disabled community.

- Differently-abled, Handi-capable, Otherly-Abled, and Special Needs: Many members of the disability community consider these terms a way to avoid the word disabled. They are seen as a way of diminishing or even erasing the experiences of disabled people. Lydia X. Z Brown provides additional details on the problem with the term differently-abled in the post, "[How 'Differently Abled' Marginalizes Disabled People](https://www.autistichoya.com/2013/08/differently-abled.html)." Read "[Disability is not a dirty word; 'handi-capable' should be retired](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2019/04/23/disability-is-not-a-dirty-word-handi-capable-should-be-retired/)" for more on the issues with these euphemisms in general. 
- Able-Bodied: This term is sometimes used instead of non-disabled. The main issue with it is that it implies that all disabled people lack "able-bodies" or the ability to use their bodies well. We recommend using the term non-disabled when referring to someone who does not have a disability.

## Use a community or individual's preferred disability language

For several years, there was a focus on person-first language (i.e. people with a disability) in the United States, but many disability communities identify as identity-first (i.e. disabled person). Both the Deaf and Autistic community want to be recognized by identity first (i.e., "I am an autistic person" rather than "I am a person with autism"). In fact, many members of the disability community have noted they prefer identity-first as their disability is a huge part of their identity and culture. However, that does not mean that all disabled people/people with disabilities prefer identity-first so it's best to ask an individual their preference.

"Never make an assumption if you are in a position to ask. If you are referring to a broad community or to a person you can’t ask, I suggest you default to the language most commonly used by members of that community – not the language commonly used by parents or allies." - Cara Liebowitz, From the article, "I am Disabled: On Identity-First Versus People-First Language."

Cara's quote is an important one. For example, parents and allies of autistic individuals often promote person-first language. However, as mentioned above, the majority of the autistic community prefers identity-first as autism isn't something detached from their identity - it is integral to who they are.  

Again, there is no "right way" when it comes to identity-first and person-first as it depends on the community and the individual. Emily Ladau provides a good overview of the complexity of this topic in her book Demystifying Disability. The most important thing to remember is that it is not okay to argue with a disabled person/person with a disability on their individual language preference. There are reasons a person can feel strongly about either person-first or identity-first. Instead, listen to why it is important to them.

Note: The Inclusive by Design website is geared towards the social model of disability, so we use identity-first language in several places on the site. However, we do our best to honor all community and individual preferences by using both identity-first and person-first language interchangeably in various places on the site. This site does not intend to declare that identity-first is the preferred language for everyone. As mentioned above, preference varies, so either identity-first or person-first language should be used based on the preference of a community or individual.

## Do not provide unsolicited advice

Don’t give unsolicited medical, emotional, or practical advice to disabled person/person with a disability. You may think it is well meaning to suggest remedies, herbs, and other friendly tips, but it often carries the assumption that the disabled person/person with a disability hasn't tried what you are recommending.
