# Shifting Left: An Organizational Commitment

“The one argument for accessibility that doesn’t get made nearly often enough is how extraordinarily better it makes some people’s lives.

## Organizational Questions to Ask

1. Are you proactively purchasing and building accessible products?
2. Do organizational policies, processes, and procedures account for disabled people/people with disabilities?
3. When accounting for disabled people/people with disabilities in your policies, processes, and procedures, how do you consider intersectionality (i.e. a person is not one identity)?
4. Is accessibility built into job descriptions and the interview hiring process?
5. Do you have a funding model and third party services set up for key communication accommodations (e.g., Captioning, PDF Remediation, Sign Language Interpreters, etc.)?
6. Are your customer support teams trained in disability etiquette?
7. Do you ensure your staff members have access to courses, conferences, and certifications in relation to accessibility?
8. Do your developers and designers have access to the automated testing reports, assistive technology, and other resources needed for building inclusive digital experiences?
9. How do you ensure organizational accountability? 
10. How do you ensure you are getting feedback from the disability community on your organizational accessibility?

## Featured Training: Supporting Workers with Disabilities

A professional with a disability may also have an aptitude for project management, graphic design, or full-stack development. But physical and social barriers in the world of work can make it difficult to fully capitalize on those skills—or worse, prevent them from securing gainful employment at all. Liz Johnson, a Paralympic gold-medalist and founder of The Ability People, seeks to knock down these barriers by helping organizations redefine how they view people with disabilities in the workforce. And in this course, she shares strategies that can help you do the same.
