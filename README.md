# Inclusive by Design: A Disability Inclusion Toolkit

This toolkit was created by the University of Massachusetts as an open source toolkit. We encourage others to use the content for their websites and adjust it accordingly. In addition, if people are interested in translating the content on the website, we encourage the submission of translations.
