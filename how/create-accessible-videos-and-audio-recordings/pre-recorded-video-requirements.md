# Pre-recorded Video Requirements

## Descriptive Transcript

### What is a descriptive transcript?
Descriptive transcripts for videos include a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content, as well as all visual information needed to understand the content.

### Who uses a descriptive transcript?
Descriptive transcripts are needed to provide audio and video content to people who are Deafblind and are also used by members of the Deaf and Blind communit as well as by people who process text information better than audio and visual/pictorial information.

## Human-Transcribed Captions
What are human-transcribed captions?
Human-transcribed captions are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information (i.e., sounds) needed to understand the content. They are displayed within the media player and are synchronized with the audio. 

### Who uses captions?
Captions provide content to people who are Deaf and others who cannot hear the audio. They are also used by people who process written information better than audio.

### When is it okay to use auto-captions?
Auto-captions can be used during meetings and other live events where human-transcribed captions haven't been requested as an accommodation. However, keep in mind that live public events such as commencement or a state of the University live stream are public-facing and thus not everyone can request an accommodation - in those cases, you should use human-transcribed captions for an inclusive and accurate experience for everyone attending virtually and in person. 

Auto-captions can also be used to get started on captions for a pre-recorded video if you haven't scripted it and decide to caption a video yourself. In that case, you must edit the captions once they are auto-transcribed to confirm proper spellings, punctuation, and timing. YouTube is recommended for auto-captions of pre-recorded videos as it will provide you with the most accurate captions for editing purposes. 

## Audio Descriptions

### What are audio descriptions?
Audio description describes visual information needed to understand the content. (For example, “Pat opens a small box, looks at a diamond engagement ring, and cries”.) Depending on the type of video and media player, description can be:

- integrated into the main script and recording (which works well for some training videos, yet not most stories)
- narration added to the main audio track and provided in an alternative version of the video (for stories)
- provided in a text file or as a separate audio track (if supported by the media player)

### Who uses audio descriptions?
Audio descriptions are used by the blind community and others who cannot see the video adequately. In addition, the epilepsy and vestibular disorder community may use audio descriptions for videos with flashing content and motion sensitivity warnings.
