# Live Video Requirements

## Basic Transcript

### What are basic transcripts?

Basic transcripts are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content.

### Who uses basic transcripts? 

Basic transcripts are used by the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community, the Deafblind community, people who are Deaf, anyone that has difficulty processing auditory information, and others.


## Human-Transcribed Captions

### What are human-transcribed captions?

Human-transcribed captions are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information (i.e., sounds) needed to understand the content. They are displayed within the media player and are synchronized with the audio. 

### Who uses captions?

Captions provide content to people who are Deaf and others who cannot hear the audio. They are also used by people who process written information better than audio.

### When is it okay to use auto-captions?

Auto-captions can be used during meetings and other live events where human-transcribed captions haven't been requested as an accommodation. However, keep in mind that live public events such as commencement or a state of the University live stream are public-facing and thus not everyone can request an accommodation - in those cases, you should use human-transcribed captions for an inclusive and accurate experience for everyone attending virtually and in person. 

Auto-captions can also be used to get started on captions for a pre-recorded video if you haven't scripted it and decide to caption a video yourself. In that case, you must edit the captions once they are auto-transcribed to confirm proper spellings, punctuation, and timing. YouTube is recommended for auto-captions of pre-recorded videos as it will provide you with the most accurate captions for editing purposes. 

## Sign Language Interpreters for Accommodation Requests and Public-Facing Livestreams

### What is sign language?
Sign languages use hand and arm movements, facial expressions, and body positions to convey meaning. Sign languages are different across regions and countries. For example, American Sign Language (ASL), Black American Sign Language (BASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and Auslan (Australian Sign Language) are different.

### Who uses sign language?
Sign language is the native language of many people who are Deaf. Some do not read or understand written language well â€” especially at the speed of most captions. Some people will want to have sign language and captions at the same time.

### Key considerations when using a sign language interpreter
- Confirm the type of sign language needed to ensure you hire the right sign language interpreter. As mentioned above, just like any language, there are multiple types of sign language.
- Capture the full signing space when either pre-recording or live streaming.
- Ensure the signer's display box is large enough. Viewers need to be able to clearly see all movements and facial expressions.
- Position the signer to avoid obscuring important information in the video. The signer is usually at the bottom right. If your video has information such as a news ticker at the bottom, position the signer above that.
