# Add alt text to images

## Who uses alt text?

Members of the disability community that leverage alt text can be blind, have low vision, be deaf-blind, or neurodivergent. The way the alt text is used varies as well - a blind, low vision, or deaf-blind person will use assistive technology. A neurodivergent person may use assistive technology or they may have website images shut off so that the alt text displays in lieu of the image. Alt text can also be used by non-disabled people when they have internet connectivity issues and images don't load on a site.

## Describe what you see in the photo in detail

Gone are the limits of 120 characters being read to screen readers. In fact, Twitter and other social media platforms now allow for up to 1,000 characters in your alt text. That being said, you should convey everything you see in the image that would be of relevance to anyone that couldn't see it. For example, in the photo below, there is a rainbow peaking out from between a tall building and a huge cloud in the sky. Below the tall building is a river and two sailboats can be seen in the river. There are additional details to the photo. You would thus describe enough details to convey the image to someone who can't see it, whether they are blind, have blurred vision, or have images shut off due to an underlying health issue where images could be a trigger.

## Be objective when describing people

When you do not know the exact identity of a person, describe the exact physical appearances you see and do not bring assumed identities into your description. Assumed identities often happen based on what you believe someone's ethnicity is in a photo and often our biases even cause us to not describe someone's physical appearance as we deem it the typical physical appearance (in several cases, blind people have reported that alt text describes someone as black or even African American in one photo, but then doesn't describe the person in the next photo as the person is white). We should describe skin tones and other physical appearances objectively. Here are the recommended skin tones to use in photos of people:

- Light Skin Tone
- Medium-Light Skin Tone
- Medium Skin Tone
- Medium-Dark Skin Tone
- Dark Skin Tone

## Do not repeat content that's already in a photo caption

If you have a caption displayed below a photo to provide context for everyone, that content should not be repeated in the alt text. If the caption includes the full description of the photo, you can mark the photo as decorative.

## Set an image as decorative when applicable

Some images are purely decorative, which means they serve no purpose to the content on the page. A good example of this is a hero image for a department in which the hero image is just providing a break between the navigation and the department homepage content, but the content depicted in the image isn't really relevant other than to add a design flare. 

Note that social media images should never be decorative. The image serves a purpose whether on Instagram or Facebook, so thus social media images should always be described.
