# Use Inclusive Content, Language, and Imagery

## Content
When writing content about disability inclusion, ensure you are encorporating disabled voices into your content. Lived experience is crucial for understanding what's impacting the disability community and the community's current views on key disability inclusion topics. 

## Language
- Avoid [ableist language and euphemisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disability-related_terms_with_negative_connotations) when writing posts as both carry negative connotations, whether a disability is used as a metaphor for a negative behavior or whether you use euphemisms such as differently-abled instead of the word disability ([#SayTheWord](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SayTheWord&src=typed_query)). And, if you accidentally use ableist language and are called out on it, the best thing to do is apologize and issue that apology as a separate post. It's also recommended that you take down the original post if it could continue to perpetuate ableist language. 
- Use the preferred language of a specific disability community. For example, the autistic, blind, and deaf communities prefer identity-first language (e.g., autistic person, blind person, deaf person). Other communities may prefer person-first language. Always do research on the community before posting about the community and remember to refer to articles written by a disabled person or a disability organization led by disabled people, not by a parent or advocate. 

## Imagery
When selecting images, consider disability inclusion representation. The disability community is diverse, which means the community can fall under one or more other marginalized groups (e.g., race, gender, sex, etc.). Make sure your representation of the disability community in your imagery is just as diverse. 

Unfortunately, not all stock imagery sites use disabled models for their photos and thus the representation can be inaccurate, from how the person holds their hands when using sign language to how a service dog is harnessed in a photo. These photos often reinforce stereotypes as well due to the unconscious biases of the photographer. 

Multiple organizations are working on compiling galleries of true disability representation. The following sites are recommended for use at this time:

- [Disabled and Here](https://affecttheverb.com/disabledandhere/) (this site also provides recommended alternative text for each photo).
- [Disability:IN Disability Inclusive Stock Photography](https://disabilityin.org/resource/disability-stock-photography/)
- [Canvaâ€™s Natural Women collection](https://www.canva.com/canvanaturalwomen)
- [Stocksy](https://www.stocksy.com/search/disability?text=disability&sort=curated)
