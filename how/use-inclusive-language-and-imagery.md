# Use Inclusive Language and Imagery

- Avoid [ableist language and euphemisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disability-related_terms_with_negative_connotations) when writing posts as both carry negative connotations, whether a disability is used as a metaphor for a negative behavior or whether you use euphemisms such as differently-abled instead of the word disability (#SayTheWord). And, if you accidentally use ableist language and are called out on it, the best thing to do is apologize and issue that apology as a separate post. It's also recommended that you take down the original post if it could continue to perpetuate ableist language. 
- Use the preferred language of a specific disability community. For example, the autistic, blind, and deaf communities prefer identity-first language (e.g., autistic person, blind person, deaf person). Other communities may prefer person-first language. Always do research on the community before posting about the community and remember to refer to articles written by a disabled person or a disability organization led by disabled people, not by a parent or advocate. 
- The disability community is diverse, which means the community can fall under one or more other marginalized groups (e.g., race, gender, sex, etc.). Make sure your representation of the disability community in your imagery is just as diverse.
- Stick with gender-neutral pronouns and terms and evaluate text for assumptions of limited points of view.
