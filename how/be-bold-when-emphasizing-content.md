# Be Bold When Emphasizing Content

- Use bold to emphasize content. You can also use a color to emphasize the content but should always use bold at the same time as not everyone perceives colors in the same or can perceive colors at all.
- Avoid the use of italics as it's harder for people with dyslexia to read as well as harder for everyone in general to read.
- Do not use underlines to emphasize text. Underlines are used to indicate hyperlinks on a page. If someone is colorblind, they may not be able to tell the difference between a hyperlink and underlined words.   
- Use standard capitalization. Do not use All Caps, unless using all caps for an acronym. All caps is generally harder to read, can come across as aggressive to a reader, and also can be read as an acronym by assistive technology.
