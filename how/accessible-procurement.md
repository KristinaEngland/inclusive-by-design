# Accessible Procurement of Digital Products and Services

"'Accessible' means a person with a disability is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use. The person with a disability must be able to obtain the information as fully, equally and independently as a person without a disability." - [South Carolina Technical College System Resolution Agreement](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/11116002-b.html), Office of Civil Rights.

## The benefits of building accessibility reviews into the procurement process

Purchasing the most accessible product or service during the procurement process is the most critical part of a product life cycle. While the product may not be fully accessible, by ensuring you have built accessibility into the procurement process, the following can happen:

- Contractual timelines can be set with vendors on critical fixes to the product or service.
- Business owners can understand the overall impact of those issues if the product were rolled out prior to the fixes being applied.
- Positions the organization to provide a more inclusive digital experience for disabled people by getting out ahead of accessibility issues.

## Request the following from all vendors

- An accessible version of their latest Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR). The Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) should be provided using the latest version of the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (WCAG Version). The report should be accessible, complying with PDF accessibility guidelines. 
- Completion of the Procurement Questionnaire. Vendors should be as detailed as possible in their responses. 
- Access to a demo environment for testing purposes.

## Internal validation of digital product and service accessibility

It's the responsibility of business owners and the Procurement Office to engage the proper internal accessibility subject matter experts or an approved third-party accessibility testing company in the procurement process. This vetting is needed to provide clear language in a contract around remediation timelines and other customer expectations.
