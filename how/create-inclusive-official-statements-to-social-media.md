# Create Inclusive Official Statements for Social Media

When posting a long statement that won't fit into a social media caption, there is a tendency to create the statement as an image, especially on platforms such as Instagram. The amount of text that would need to be conveyed to assistive technology in most long statements creates cognitive overload. In addition, the font size used in these statements is often small and hard for the low vision community to read.

Instead, either communicate that statement via a video or link to a webpage with the full statement. Do not post the statement as an image on your post as that will render it inaccessible to assistive technology. If you want to post an image to your social media, think of posting an image that calls attention to the fact that you have linked to a long statement on a webpage rather than posting a flattened version of the statement in the image field. This will keep the source statement as text so that when people go to share it, they don't share an inaccessible flattened image instead.
