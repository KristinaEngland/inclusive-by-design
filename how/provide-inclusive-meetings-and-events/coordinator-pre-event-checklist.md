# Coordinator Pre-Event Checklist

## 1. Select an Accessible Venue for In-Person Meetings

When selecting where to hold an in-person event, ensure the location meets physical accessibility guidelines, including: 

- The location is part of an accessible transportation route.
- Signs with braille are posted outside conference rooms, hotel rooms, and bathrooms.
- Accessible parking spaces are available.
- There are accessible ramps to enter the building and for presentation stages.
- There are accessible elevators that work.
- The location has wide doorways and hallways.
- Auditoriums and training rooms have built-in accessible seating spaces, especially when seats are fixed to the ground.
- There are clear paths in and around your venue for blind and physically disabled people.
- Wheelchair accessible public bathrooms are available and close to the conference rooms.
- The venue has accessible floor maps or instructions. 
- Ensure there are enough power outlets for people to charge their assistive technology.
- Ensure there is a microphone system. The use of microphones help anyone who is hard of hearing to hear what's happening. Check to see if there is a hearing loop system as well and, if there is, include that information in your pre-event communications. 
- Follow up with your ADA Coordinator for more information and for accessible location recommendations. 

## 2. Ensure Online Events are Accessible and Inclusive

- Ensure the online platform you are using for the event complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Check with your IT office on pre-approved accessible meeting platforms. 
- Ensure you can spotlight a sign language interpreter for the event if a sign language interpreter has been requested for an accommodation.  
- Ensure there are multiple ways for attendees to communicate rather than relying on one communication method alone. Not everyone can speak their questions so providing both the ability to speak and type questions is best. 
- Turn video off by default and let attendees determine if they want to enable video. Video is optional and can be beneficial to some, such as attendees that rely on lip reading, but not beneficial to others (for example, anyone with sensory and vestibular triggers may choose to have the view of other attendees' videos off and the video view hidden). 

## 3. Select Diverse Speakers

- Ensure you have a diverse and inclusive speaker lineup (gender, ethnicity, disability, etc.). There are plenty of diverse speakers that can speak on any topic, especially when we tap into our campus faculty and researchers.
- If specifically seeking out presenters on DEI topics, ensure the people you are contacting to present on that topic have experience presenting on the topic and you are not just reaching out to them based on their perceived identities. 
- Request biographies from the speakers. Do not pull biographies from their past events on the web. The biography may be out of date and the person may not feel it represents who they are now. 

## 4. Ensure All Event Communications are Accessible and Inclusive
- Ensure the registration process for a meeting or event is accessible, including the general event registration form, accommodation form, sponsorship and exhibitor sign up forms, etc.
- Ensure all social media posts marketing an event are accessible.
- If you are using an email marketing platform, ensure the platform delivers accessible emails. Provide an option for viewing the web version of the email.
- Use the Create Inclusive Content checklist to ensure all communication content sent to attendees is accessible.
- Provide attendees with a way to identify their pronouns.
- Include diverse representation in your imagery (e.g., age, disability, ethnicity, etc.).

## 5. Manage Accommodation Requests
- Provide a way for attendees to request accommodations in your communications, such as accessible seating, human-transcribed live captions and transcript, alternative materials, dietary restrictions, or an in-person guide.
- Ensure accommodation requests are documented, completed, and that you confirm with the attendee that their accommodation has been processed. 

## 6. Establish a Captioning Plan

Your plan for captioning and transcripts will vary depending on whether you have an accommodation request for human-transcribed captions. 

- Provide human-transcribed captions for an accommodation request. When looking for someone to transcribe captions for an event, you will want to book a professional Communication Real-Time translation (CART) provider. You should work with the ADA Coordinator to obtain a list of approved CART providers to ensure quality captions are provided. When using a CART provider, ensure that the provider can offer both captions and an interactive transcript. Note that you can use human-transcribed captions for an event even if you do not have an accommodation request come in. Auto-captions might misrepresent the spoken content due to mispronunciations, accents, dialects, or background noise, and editing low quality auto-captions can be time-consuming after the fact if you need to communicate recordings.
- Establish a backup plan if human-transcribed captions stop working via an event platform. Captions can occasionally stop working when fed into event platforms, such as Zoom. In that case, a CART provider will have a backup link to their hosted transcript. You should ask for that link prior to the event should you need to communicate it if captioning issues arise. In the case of captions failing completely, you can either try enabling auto-captions or you may need to use chat and have someone on staff that can provide backup captions through chat. Either way, it's best to be ready for a workaround should an issue arise. 
- Use auto-captions when no accommodation request is received. Auto-captions can be beneficial to the neurodiverse community, hard of hearing community, people with audio issues, people in a noisy setting, and anyone where English is their secondary language.  Auto-captions along with an interactive transcript should be available in most meeting platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Zoom, etc.). They should be tested with presenters prior to the event or meeting to ensure that the quality of the auto-captions will be sufficient. A speaker's accent or dialect can have an impact on the quality of the auto-captions due to auto-captions not being trained yet in all accents and dialects. The auto-captions delivered in that case can be inaccurate and, at times, even embarrassing. The last thing you want to do is offend either the speaker or attendees participating in the event. 

## 7. Confirm AV Support Requirements

- Ensure you do a dry-run with AV support if you have any presenters using assistive technology. AV teams do not always have prior training on how best to configure the sound system to work, whether to deliver the sound of assistive technology through the sound system or to cancel out the assistive technology sound. 

## 8. Communicate Dietary, Sensory, and Allergy Information for In-Person Events

- Communicate where dietary and allergy food will be located during the event. 
- Communicate a fragrance-free policy for both sensory and allergy purposes.
- Designate a quiet space for anyone with sensory issues and communicate that space will be available for use throughout the event. 

## 9. Communicate All Materials Ahead of Time

- Ensure that all presenters create accessible materials ahead of the event that can be shared prior to the event.
- Share documents with attendees prior to the meeting or event for anyone that needs to follow along.
