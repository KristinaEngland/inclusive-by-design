# Presenter Accessibility Checklist

## 1. Create and Select Inclusive Presentation Materials

- Create accessible documents using the checklist on the the Create Inclusive Content page.
- Build in trigger warnings if you plan to show any animations, whether a Giphy or an animations on a website (e.g., auto-playing videos, parallax, etc.). People with epilepsy and vestibular disorders can be triggered by certain animations. 
- Build in trigger warnings for any content that may trigger past trauma for an attendee. 
- Ensure you build in links to transcripts for any audio clips used during your presentation and links to captions and transcripts for video clips.

## 2. Describe Visual Information During Your Presentation

- Describe any visuals you present. Ask yourself, "If someone couldn't see the visual, what would they miss if it wasn't described?"
- Note when you've transitioned to a new slide or resource for anyone following along with alternative materials. 

## 3. Use a Microphone During an In-Person Presentation
- Use a microphone in a large room. A microphone helps to amplify your voice for everyone in the room, including anyone who is hard of hearing, any live captioners or sign language interpreters, or anyone who may be distracted by other noises in the room.
- Provide participants with a microphone during any question or answer sessions and reiterate the need to speak through the microphone when asking a question. If you are unable to get the microphone to the person, repeat the question for everyone in the room.

## 4. Use a Headset During a Virtual Presentation
- Background noises can be distracting to the neurodiverse community. Use a headset to provide a distraction free presetnation.
