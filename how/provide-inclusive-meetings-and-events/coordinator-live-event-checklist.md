# Coordinator Live Event Checklist

## 1. Post Any Custom Accessible Signage for an In-Person Event

Post any custom accessible signage that you needed to make for the event, including braille signage for any venue rooms missing braille signs as well as signage for the sensory break room.

## 2. Communicate Event Logistics and Guidelines
