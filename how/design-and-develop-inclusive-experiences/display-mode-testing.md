# Display Mode Testing

## What are display modes?
Most computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and web browsers have specialized tools to help people read and take action on the content they display. Some of these tools are display modes, which are pre-defined visual configurations you can tell your device to use. Five such modes are Dark Mode, Increased Contrast Mode, Inverted Colors Mode, Reduced Motion Mode, and High Contrast Mode. 

The benefits of each display mode varies. For example, high contrast mode prioritizes legibility of content above all else, while reduced motion mode allows a person to express a preference for animation to be slowed down, or removed entirely.

## Common issues identified during Display Mode testing

- When reduced motion user preferences are enabled, animations and auto-playing videos do not disable or slow down.
- When high contrast mode is enabled, the product or service does not reflect the color customizations made by the user.
- When dark mode is enabled, the product or service does not convert to dark mode.

## Testing Resources
The A11y Project provides how to test in all five modes in their article, "[Operating System and Browser Accessibility Display Modes](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2020-01-23-operating-system-and-browser-accessibility-display-modes/)."
