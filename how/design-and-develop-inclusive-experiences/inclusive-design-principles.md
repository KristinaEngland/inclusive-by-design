# Inclusive Design Principles

## About the Inclusive Design Principles
The [Inclusive Design Principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/) are about putting people first. It's about designing for the needs of people with permanent, temporary, situational, or changing disabilities â€” all of us really. They are intended to give anyone involved in the design and development of websites and applications - designers, user experience professionals, developers, product owners, idea makers, innovators, artists and thinkers - a broad approach to inclusive design.

## The Seven Principles
There are seven inclusive design principles. The high level descriptions of each are as follows. The [Inclusive Design Principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/) site includes detailed definitions as well as real world examples that all designs and developers should read through. 

1. Provide comparable experience: Ensure your interface provides a comparable experience for all so people can accomplish tasks in a way that suits their needs without undermining the quality of the content.
2. Consider situation: People use your interface in different situations. Make sure your interface delivers a valuable experience to people regardless of their circumstances.
3. Be consistent: Use familiar conventions and apply them consistently.
4. Give control: Ensure people are in control. People should be able to access and interact with content in their preferred way.
5. Offer choice: Consider providing different ways for people to complete tasks, especially those that are complex or non standard.
6. Prioritise content: Help users focus on core tasks, features, and information by prioritising them within the content and layout.
7. Add value: Consider the value of features and how they improve the experience for different users.
