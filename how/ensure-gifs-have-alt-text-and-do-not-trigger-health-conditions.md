# Ensure Gifs Have Alt Text and Do Not Trigger Health Conditions

- Describe your Gif. Gifs are meant to convey your current mood visually. Many social media platforms currently do not support the addition of alt text for gifs so you will need to check if there is an alt text function. Even with the alt text function, it's best to also provide a description of the Gif in your post. Why? Anyone with epilepsy or a vestibular disorder will have animations shut off so they will need the visual description of what they are missing within the post as they do not use assistive technology, so they will not get the alt text conveyed to them if it is added behind the scenes. 
- Ensure the Gifs you select cannot trigger a seizure or vestibular disorder. You can test seizure triggers with the [PEAT Tool](https://trace.umd.edu/peat/). In general, watch for any rapid flashing content as it can trigger both seizures and vestibular disorders. Also watch for fast, jarring movements, parallax effect movements, or a pinch and zoom effect. Remember that anyone can have their first seizure or vestibular trigger at any point in their life so the animation you share could trigger a first time health condition. This is not to dissuade you from using Gifs, but to get you thinking thoughtfully about the type of Gif you are sharing.
