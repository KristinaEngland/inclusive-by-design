# Design accessible graphics

- Ensure that the text and background colors meet color contrast guidelines. You can confirm color contrast using the [Web AIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
- Donâ€™t rely on color to convey meaning.  In graphs or infographics, use symbols or patterns as an alternative or addition to color. Or, add clarifying labels.
- [Provide alternative text](https://kristinaengland.github.io/inclusive-by-design/how/add-alt-text) that describes what's contained within the graphic, unless that content is already conveyed in your content.
