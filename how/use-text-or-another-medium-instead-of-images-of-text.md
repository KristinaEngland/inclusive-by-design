# Use Text or Another Medium Instead of Images of Text

When designing content for the web, use actual text in your design, whether creating an email, a table of contents, a call out box, or other type of marketing content. A hero image is fine for an email, but having the whole email as a poster creates significant access issues. 

## What barriers does an image of text create?

An image of text can often not be resized with zoom/magnification tools. 
An image of text for can be hard to convey through alt text, especially a table screenshot, which can be impossible to describe through alt text.
The text in the image becomes unsearchable and cannot be translated into other languages.
If someone has images disabled due to low bandwidth or sensory issues, they lose the visual means in which the content was conveyed. 
Prevents any user from copy pasting that content for personal notes or other purposes.

## Options for Inclusive Official Statements on Social Media

When posting an official statement that won't fit into a social media caption, there is a tendency to create the statement as an image, especially on platforms such as Instagram. The amount of text that would need to be conveyed to assistive technology in most long statements creates cognitive overload. The font size used in these statements is often small and hard for the low vision community to read. In addition, if people screenshot an image-based statement, even if you added alt text to the original statement, your image-based version could be shared in an inaccessible format across social media. 

Instead, either communicate that statement via a video or link to a webpage with the full statement. This ensures that the source statement is accessible and reduces the likelihood that others will share it in an inaccessible format. You can even have a note indicating why you have the long statement in either a video or webpage-based format, helping others to understand the importance of accessible content.

If you want to post an image to your social media, post an image that calls attention to the fact that you have linked to a long statement in a video or on a webpage.
