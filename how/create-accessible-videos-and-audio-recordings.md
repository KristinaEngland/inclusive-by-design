# Create Accessible Videos and Audio Recordings

## General Best Practices to Follow

- Use the decision tree below to determine what alternative communication formats you need for your multimedia (e.g., captions, descriptive transcripts, etc.). Alternative communication formats will vary by media type. 
- Ensure the video player or podcast platform you select is accessible. Reach out to the Digital Experience team with any questions before selecting a platform.
- Script what you are going to say before recording a video, if possible. This script can then be used for both captioning and transcripts. 
- Use clear language and spell out acronyms.
- Individuals who have photosensitive seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered by content that flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes. A seizure can lead to hospitalization or death, so it's crucial to test any videos or animations that contain flashing content to ensure they don't surpass the required threshold. Videos and animations should not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period. [Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT)](https://trace.umd.edu/peat/) allows you to test general flash failures, red flash failures, and extended flash warnings. While you can add a trigger warning to a video, keep in mind that [anyone can develop epilepsy at any point in their life](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/about-epilepsy-basics/who-gets-epilepsy) so your video could be their first trigger, so they wouldn't know to pay attention to a trigger warning. While animation can be fun, it can also be harmful.  
- Ensure that videos cannot trigger vestibular disorders. Jarring and unsteady movement in videos, or erratic zooming in and out, can trigger vestibular disorders such as vertigo and migraines.
- Make any overlay text readable, ensuring it follows the color contrast guidelines and ensuring it is not placed in the area in which captions will appear if someone has captions enabled.
- Some people use mouth movement to help understand spoken language. When feasible, ensure that the speakerâ€™s face is visible and in good light.
- Use human transcribed captions for any live stream accommodation requests or for any pre-recorded videos. If you don't receive a request for captions for a live event, you can use automated captions. Just remember to edit the captions on the recorded video before publishing it.
