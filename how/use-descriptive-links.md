# Use Descriptive Links

- Use descriptive labels, such as read the University of Massachusetts About page. In most cases, the exact name of the page, document, or other media that you are pointing the person to is the name you should use as it will provide the best contextual information for everyone, regardless of whether they are using assistive technology or visually skimming a page.
- Do not use "click here," "read more," or "learn more," as they provide unclear descriptions to screen reader users, who must then read the content surrounding it. In addition, if there is more than one click here on the page, it prevents anyone using speech recognition software from accessing activating the link or button in an efficient way. 
- Ensure your descriptive link is unique from other links on the page. Similar to having "read more" on the page, if you have five links that are named the same, there is not enough context for a screen reader user and a speech recognition user will be unable to activate the link with its name. 
- For print materials or for presentations where you need to read out the url, use a free url shortener service, such as Bitly or TinyUrl.
