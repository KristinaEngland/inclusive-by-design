## Use PDFs Sparingly 
PDFs require extra tagging for screen reader users and prevents low vision users from resizing text for large font printing purposes, so where possible, you should keep the document in the source format.

## Should Your Document Be a Document?
You should also always ask yourself whether a document should be a document. Would it be better served to all audiences as an html page, whether a news story, a knowledge article, or a general web page?
