## Complete Microsoft's Accessibility Training
Ensure documents are created with document accessibility best practices in mind. There are knowledge base articles for each type of document (PowerPoint, Word, Excel).

## Use PDFs Sparingly 
PDFs require extra tagging for screen reader users and prevents low vision users from resizing text for large font printing purposes, so where possible, you should keep the document in the source format.

## Use ePubs instead of PDFs for books, journals, and other long-form texts. 
Correct use of XHTML markup and CSS style sheets in an EPUB file results in search and navigation functionalities, support for text-to-speech/braille and speech recognition technologies.

## Should Your Document Be a Document?
You should also always ask yourself whether a document should be a document. Would it be better served to all audiences as an html page, whether a news story, a knowledge article, or a general web page?
