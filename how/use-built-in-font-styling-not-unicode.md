# Use Built-in Font Styling, Not Unicode

Several social media platforms provide standard font styling, which is accessible. There are sites that provide alternative fonts, weights, and styles that you may think are pretty, but they are actually not accessible. In fact, assistive technology will skip over the content that is styled using this custom unicode completely. That means it could skip over words that you have bolded for emphasis or it could skip over your entire post if it's been done with a custom font.
