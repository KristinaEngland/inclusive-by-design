# Use Tables Correctly

- All tables should have an assigned header row. Assigning the header row ensures that assistive technology can read each cell of content and connect that content back to the assigned header. 
- Do not merge table rows as this breaks header row accessibility.
- Tables should be used for the comparison of data, not for layout purposes (i.e., do not use tables to create columns on the page - this creates both accessibility and mobile responsiveness issues).
- Do not copy paste tables into an html page from a Microsoft document as the code from the document will not paste over correctly and will create issues with the code and styling on the site.
