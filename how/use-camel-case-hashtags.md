# Use Camel Case Hashtags

When adding hashtags to your posts, always use CamelCase, such as #ILoveMassachusetts. There are two benefits to using CamelCase:

- Assistive technology, such as screen readers and text-to-speech software, will read the individual words correctly based on the capitalization of the first letter of each word.
- CamelCase is easier for anyone to read when multiple words are combined in a hashtag.
