# Verify Others' Posts Before Sharing Them

Consider all of the social media best practices before sharing a post by someone else.

When it comes to alt text, which you can't check visually, you can enable either NVDA on your Windows computer or VoiceOver on your Mac to confirm there is alt text. You can also check alt text on mobile with VoiceOver or TalkBack. 

Never assume based on the poster that the content is accessible. Unfortunately, there are several disability not-for-profits that don't make their content accessible to all disability communities as they may only be thinking of their specific community when creating posts. The same goes for advocates - just because an advocate is promoting the cause, it doesn't mean they truly know what disability inclusion is yet. 

## How do I handle inaccessible posts by others?

- You can contact the person directly and ask them to add alt text to an image or closed captions and a transcript to a video.
- You can also share a post that contains an inaccessible image and when you share it, post an image description in your re-post.
