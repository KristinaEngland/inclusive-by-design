# Design accessible marketing graphics

- Infographics, banners, and call to actions should be created with HTML and CSS when implemented on websites. When posting to social media or via an email marketing campaign, you can generate the graphic as an image. 
- Ensure that the text and background colors meet color contrast guidelines. You can confirm color contrast using the [Web AIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
- Donâ€™t rely on color to convey meaning.  In graphs or infographics, use symbols or patterns as an alternative or addition to color. Or, add clarifying labels.
- [Provide alternative text](https://kristinaengland.github.io/inclusive-by-design/how/provide-alt-text-for-images) that describes what's contained within the graphic, unless the information is already conveyed in your content. Important: You must provide alt text for images in social media - there is no decorative image checkbox.
