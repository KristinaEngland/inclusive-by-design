# Ensure use of emojis does not impact readability

## Do not rely on an emoji to substitute a word. 

Emojis aren't always conveyed to assistive technology and sometimes their descriptive labels do not match what you think the emoji means. Use the emoji at the end of a sentence instead such as saying "I love football!" followed by a football emoji.

## Do not use emojis in between words in a sentence. 

An example of this is when the clapping hands emoji is used between words in a post.

![Twitter post of I am so happy it's Friday! message with clapping hand emojis between each word.](https://github.com/KristinaEngland/inclusive-by-design/blob/gh-pages/assets/img/clapping%20hands%20emoji%20post.png)

This post reads as follows to assistive technology: "I graphic clickable emoji colon, clapping hands sign am graphic clickable emoji colon, clapping hands sign so graphic clickable emoji colon, clapping hands sign happy graphic clickable emoji colon, clapping hands sign it's graphic clickable emoji colon, clapping hands sign Friday!

## Try not to repeat a bunch of emojis at the end of your post over and over again. 

Some people do this for styling purposes. Having a canoe and a maple leaf once after your post will convey the visual and make everyone smile at the conveyed imagery. Having a canoe and a maple leaf repeated over 20 times at the end of a post creates an overwhelming and frustrating experience for anyone using assistive technology. 

Example of what not to do:

![Canoe and maple leaf used on repeat after each other, both used 15 times, making for a total of 30 emojis that would be read to assistive technology.](https://github.com/KristinaEngland/inclusive-by-design/blob/gh-pages/assets/img/canoe%20maple%20leaf%20emojis%20on%20repeat.jpeg)

## Finally, do not use text-based emoticons

Text-based emtoicons, such as the shruggie that's made out of macrons, slashes, etc., will be read aloud by assistive technology as the actual keystrokes, rather than the visual represented. In the case of the shruggie, it will be read as, “Macron, backslash, underline, katakana, underline, slash, macron.”
